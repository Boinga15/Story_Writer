# Story_Writer
A basic story writer I made in my spare time. Allows users to write, view, edit, and delete stories that they can create.

Note: In order for the program to fully work, you have to first unzip the zip folder in the files. If there aren't any empty folders inside of the file, create three empty folders, named STORIES, MUSIC, and IMAGES respectively on the same level as the main.py.

The project uses Python 2.7.x with usage of the following libraries: os, sys, time, keyboard, and webbrowser. The reason this doesn't use Python 3 is because the programming software I used to program this wouldn't work with Python 3, so I was forced to use Python 2. I will try to update it to Python 3 as soon as possible.

At the start, the user can type in commands to create, delete, and view their stories. When writing a story, the program uses notepad in order to allow the user to input text. It also allows them to read their stories with an inbuilt chapter system.

When writing stories, users can also use {} to indicate commands to play music, show images, pause the story, or skip the line altogether, giving them more control over the flow of the story. Read the Commands.txt file for more instructions on how to do this.
