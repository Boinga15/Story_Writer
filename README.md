# Story_Writer
A basic story writer I made in my spare time. Allows users to write, view, edit, and delete stories that they can create.

The project uses Python 2.7.x with usage of the following libraries: os, sys, time, keyboard, and webbrowser. The reason this doesn't use Python 3 is because the programming software I used to program this wouldn't work with Python 3, so I was forced to use Python 2. I will try to update it to Python 3 as soon as possible.

At the start, the user can type in commands to create, delete, and view their stories. When writing a story, the program uses notepad in order to allow the user to input text. It also allows them to read their stories with an inbuilt chapter system.

I am planning to eventually improve this project's design over the course of a few months before moving on, as there is a lot that can be done, such as making the description word wrap like the text in stories or allowing for the use of commands inside of stories to forcefully skip lines, play music, or wait to add tension.
